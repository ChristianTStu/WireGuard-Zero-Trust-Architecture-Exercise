# WireGuard Zero Trust Architecture Exercise

Welcome to the WireGuard Zero Trust Architecture Exercise repository. This project is designed to guide you through the process of replacing traditional VPN setups with WireGuard within a Zero Trust framework. Below are detailed steps on how to install, configure, and verify WireGuard VPN connections.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a personal laboratory setup, as our Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) does not support VPN client installations.

## Installation

1. **Visit WireGuard's Official Website:**
    - Start by reading about WireGuard at their [official website](https://www.wireguard.com/).
2. **Download and Install WireGuard:**
    - Follow the instructions provided on the website to download and install WireGuard on your system.

## Configuration

3. **Quickstart Guide:**
    - Familiarize yourself with WireGuard by viewing the Quickstart Guide available at [WireGuard Quickstart](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/). This guide provides essential information to help you understand the setup process.

## Verification

4. **Setup a VPN Connection:**
    - Using the knowledge acquired from the Quickstart guide, set up a WireGuard VPN connection. 
5. **Operational Testing:**
    - Perform a network ping test as demonstrated in the Quickstart video. This will help verify the correct setup of your VPN connection.

## Submission

6. **Capture and Submit Evidence:**
    - Take a screenshot of the ping test result and upload it here as part of your exercise deliverables.
